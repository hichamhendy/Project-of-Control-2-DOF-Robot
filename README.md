Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) becomes one of the interesting possibilities to
provide an optimized solution regarding the previous mentioned aspects. This technical
documentation explains many tested approaches for solving Rest-to-Rest control of a 2 DoF
Robot problem. By designing such a problem one should considered five main pillar . First,
we should find an admissible controls. Second, Mathematical Description of the plant should
be available. Third, Performance criterion should be specified. Forth, Plant constrains are
very crucial and limiting our solution and must be precisely defined and satisfied by solving. At the end comes the optimal criteria . Three Main Issues arise by designing an NMPC
namely, Feasibility, Convergence and Stability. Theses issues decide if we are going to find an
optimal solution or not.
